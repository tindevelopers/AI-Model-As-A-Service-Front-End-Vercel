# Fix Vercel Deployment Configuration

## Problem
The `develop` branch is currently deploying to the production environment, which is incorrect. The proper setup should be:

- `main` branch → Production (ai-maas-production.tinconnect.com)
- `staging` branch → Staging environment  
- `develop` branch → Development/Preview environment (no production deployment)

## Current Issue
Vercel is automatically deploying from all branches because the Git integration is set to deploy from any branch push.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Configure Vercel Project Settings (via Web Dashboard)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/tindeveloper/ai-model-as-a-service/settings/git
2. Configure branch deployment settings:
   - **Production Branch**: `main` only
   - **Preview Branches**: `staging`, `develop` (optional)
   - **Ignore Build Step**: Configure for `develop` branch to prevent production deployments

### 2. Alternative: Use Vercel CLI to reconfigure
```bash
# Disconnect and reconnect with proper configuration
vercel git disconnect
vercel git connect https://github.com/tindevelopers/AI-Model-As-A-Service-Front-End-Vercel.git
```

### 3. Update GitHub Actions
The current GitHub Actions are correctly configured:
- `main` branch → Production deployment
- `staging` branch → Staging deployment  
- `develop` branch → Testing only (no deployment)

### 4. Verify Branch Protection Rules
Ensure GitHub branch protection rules are in place:
- `main` branch: Protected, requires PR
- `staging` branch: Protected, requires PR
- `develop` branch: Open for development

## Expected Result
After configuration:
- Pushes to `main` → Production deployment
- Pushes to `staging` → Staging deployment
- Pushes to `develop` → No deployment (or preview only)
- Pull Requests → Preview deployments only

## Verification
Check deployment URLs:
- Production: https://ai-maas-production.tinconnect.com (main branch only)
- Staging: https://ai-model-as-a-service-staging.vercel.app (staging branch)
- Preview: https://ai-model-as-a-service-[branch].vercel.app (PR previews)
